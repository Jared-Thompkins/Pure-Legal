  <p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>Effective August 27, 2025</p>

  <p>Pure Camera App (“Pure”) is a native iOS application designed to provide a simple, high-quality camera experience without distractions. The App allows users to capture photos and videos, which are securely stored in private cloud storage. Metadata such as file type, size, and creation date is managed separately to support features like gallery organization and media access. The App does not include advertising, social media integrations, or algorithmic feeds. Instead, it is built with a focus on privacy, security, and user control.</p>

  <p><strong>What information does Pure collect?</strong></p>
  <p>Pure collects only the information that is necessary to provide and improve the App. The categories of information Pure may collect include:</p>
  <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in, Pure collects your phone number for authentication purposes. This information is used solely to verify your identity and to maintain your account.</p>
  <p><strong>Media Content:</strong> When you capture photos or videos within the App, the content is securely stored in encrypted cloud storage. Metadata associated with this content (such as file type, file size, and creation date) is also stored to enable features like gallery organization and playback. Pure does not analyze, sell, or share your media content for advertising or profiling purposes.</p>
  <p><strong>Usage Information:</strong> Pure may collect limited technical information about how you interact with the App, such as device type, operating system, and error logs. This helps us improve performance, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compatibility.</p>
  <p><strong>Feedback and Support:</strong> If you choose to provide feedback or contact support through the App, Pure collects the information you submit (such as text feedback or messages) in order to respond and improve the App.</p>
  <p>Pure does not collect precise location data, contact lists, browsing history, or any information unrelated to the core functionality of the App.</p>

  <p><strong>How does Pure use this information?</strong></p>
  <p>Pure uses the information collected solely to provide, maintain, and improve the functionality of the App. Your phone number is used only for authentication and account security, ensuring that only you can access your media. Photos, videos, and their associated metadata are stored securely to enable features such as viewing, organizing, and retrieving your content in the gallery. Technical information, such as error logs or device type, may be used to diagnose issues, enhance performance, and support future improvements.</p>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and Pure does not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
  <p>Pure may use trusted third-party service providers (such as cloud hosting and authentication providers) to store and process information securely on our behalf. If you provide feedback or contact support, Pure uses the information you share to respond to your request and to improve the App.</p>
  <p>Pure does not use your information for advertising, profiling, or selling to third parties.</p>

  <p><strong>How can you manage or delete your information and exercise your rights?</strong></p>
  <p>You are in control of your information. Within the App, you may manage your account settings and request deletion of your account at any time. If you choose to delete your account, your authentication credentials, media files, and related metadata will be permanently removed from our systems, subject to any limited legal or compliance obligations.</p>

  <p>Pure may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If Pure makes material changes, Pure will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy or by providing notice within the App.</p>
